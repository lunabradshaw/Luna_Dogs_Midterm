	<body><h1>Luna loves dogs</h1>
	<section><h2>Labradoodle</h2>
		<p>I grew up with cats and have loved them but when I met my husband Brian he told me he always wanted a dog growing up and his parents wouldn't have it. oh what mean parents, lol. So we have decided to get a Labradoodle from a breeder in Ontario. Neither of us have had dogs in our life but we feel that a dog is "mans/womens best friend" and how can you go wrong with that! </p>
		<p>We love going for walks, which is kinda difficult with a cat, hence why we are pro dog lovers. We love that a dog can keep you active more than a cat, going on runs with it. We also just feel like we would love to have the opportunity to love a beutiful creature like a dog.</p>
		<p> Cats can be wonderful but I feel a dog is more like having a child and we don't plan on having a human one so we decided to get a furry one instead.</p>
